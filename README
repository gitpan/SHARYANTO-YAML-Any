NAME
    SHARYANTO::YAML::Any - SHARYANTO::YAML::Any - Pick a YAML implementation
    and use it.

VERSION
    version 0.721

SYNOPSIS
        use SHARYANTO::YAML::Any;
        $SHARYANTO::YAML::Indent = 3;
        my $yaml = Dump(@objects);

DESCRIPTION
    SHARYANTO::YAML::Any is forked from YAML::Any. The difference is the
    order of implementation selection (YAML::Syck first, as YAML::XS does
    not work well with some of my YAML docs) and the setting
    ($YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping is turned on, as any sane YAML user would
    do). The rest is YAML::Any's documentation.

    There are several YAML implementations that support the Dump/Load API.
    This module selects the best one available and uses it.

ORDER
    Currently, YAML::Any will choose the first one of these YAML
    implementations that is installed on your system:

        YAML::XS
        YAML::Syck
        YAML::Old
        YAML
        YAML::Tiny

OPTIONS
    If you specify an option like:

        $YAML::Indent = 4;

    And YAML::Any is using YAML::XS, it will use the proper variable:
    $YAML::XS::Indent.

SUBROUTINES
    Like all the YAML modules that YAML::Any uses, the following subroutines
    are exported by default:

        Dump
        Load

    and the following subroutines are exportable by request:

        DumpFile
        LoadFile

METHODS
    YAML::Any provides the following class methods.

    YAML::Any->order;
        This method returns a list of the current possible implementations
        that YAML::Any will search for.

    YAML::Any->implementation;
        This method returns the implementation the YAML::Any will use. This
        result is obtained by finding the first member of YAML::Any->order
        that is either already loaded in %INC or that can be loaded using
        "require". If no implementation is found, an error will be thrown.
